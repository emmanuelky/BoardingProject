# BoardingProject
Boarding. A website we built in MongoDB, Express, Node, HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap.
This was achieved after 6wks at Ironhack Berlin.

Its a platform where users can create, join or attend events based on their current location. Users can create virtually any event and invite others.
